Overview:
Most people who have left work 6 hours and 10 hours per day.
The salary falls in low or medium level for large percentage of those who have left.
On average people who leave have a low satisfaction level, they work more and didn’t get promoted within the past five years.
Some people don’t work well as we can find from their evaluation, but clearly there are also many good workers that leave.
The dismission rate of employees who have 3 projects is lower than those with 2 or 4~7 projects.


Problems to be considered:
How to retain the most valuable employees?
What is the priority for the company - what kind of strategy should be adopted?
